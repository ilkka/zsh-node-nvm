# Zsh Node and Nvm plugin

This combines and fixes up node and nvm Antigen plugin work from several sources into a format that I like and that works for me.

Sources:

- npm completion code from https://github.com/srijanshetty/node.plugin.zsh/
- nvm completion code from https://github.com/olesu/oh-my-zsh-plugin-nvm/
